## 🖼️ Image Compression

To keep the site fast and GitHub pushes smooth, all images should be optimized before committing. A helper script `compress.sh` is included in the repo for this purpose.

### How to use:

1. Make sure the script is executable (run once):
   ```bash
   chmod +x compress.sh
   ```

2. Run the script to compress images:
   ```bash
   ./compress.sh
   ```

3. Review changes, then commit and push as usual:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Optimized images"
   git push origin main
   ```

**Note:** ⚠️ Always run `compress.sh` before committing new or updated images to keep file sizes small and avoid push issues.

## 📂 Versioning & Updates
