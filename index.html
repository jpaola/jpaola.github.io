				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>
					I've always been a committed problem solver, an independent introvert, and someone rather
					artistically inclined.
					As a software engineer it's safe to say that all of these elements get translated well
					into my work.
				</p>
				<p>
					I started learning to code when I was in University. The concepts did not come easy at first. Though
					after a rough time trying to grasp programming concepts, I realized the reason of my struggle to
					pick
					them up. I am naturally wired to question everything often finding myself putting together questions
					like: Who started this idea? What problem is this meant to solve? Where can I apply this skill? When
					should I apply this skill? Why do I need to understand this? How can I explain this in layman's
					terms? You see, once you figure out your personal method of
					learning, everything else begins to make sense.
				</p>
				<p>
					Nowadays I am constantly learning new things from technology, to art, to literature, to music, to
					personal health and fitness. Among my interests for technology you may find me reading about System
					Design, Engineering Principles and Tools, to Frontend and Backend concepts. Lately I have been
					looking into the newest trends with Frontend tools like HTML semantics,
					CSS, JavaScript, React.js.

				<h2>Art</h2>
				<p>
					I've mentioned art a couple of times already and that's because art makes everything much more
					beautiful. You may catch me sketching something, or creating something from a portrait to a
					book. Art is my crutch and what I use to meditate that is if I am not out for a long walk with my
					doggo, Hachi, or a
					jog. I cannot jog with Hachi though. She would get in front of me unexpectedly and I would most
					definitely
					fall on my face.
