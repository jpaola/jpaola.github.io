				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>
					I've always been a committed problem solver, an independent introvert, and someone rather
					artistically inclined.
					As a software engineer it's safe to say that all of these elements get translated well
					into my work.
				</p>
				<p>
					My introduction to code was during my days in University. I had a rough time trying to grasp
					programming concepts. It wasn't long until I finally realized the reason of my struggle to pick them
					up. I am naturally wired to question everything often finding myself putting together questions
					like: Who started this idea? What problem is this meant to solve? Where can I apply this skill? When
					should I apply this skill? Why do I need to understand this? How can I explain this in layman's
					terms?
				</p>
				<p>
					You see, once you figure out your personal method of
					learning, everything else begins to make sense.
				</p>

				<h2>Art</h2>
				<p>
					Art makes everything much more
					beautiful. You may catch me sketching something. I enjoy crafts that enable me to use my
					imagination. Often times you may find me drawing, learning color mixing, or putting together a book.
					Art is my crutch and what I use to meditate. My favorite artist is Oscar-Claude Monet.
					Something about his paintings really resonates with me.
				</p>
				<p>
					Check out my first ever published coloring book on Amazon.
